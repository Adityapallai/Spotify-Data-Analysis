ðŸŽ§ Spotify Music Streaming Data Analysis | Power BI Project

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Spotify music streaming data to uncover meaningful insights about user behavior, listening habits, and content performance. The data consists of user-level playback events including track metadata, play duration, platform used, and listening interactions such as skipping and shuffling.
The objective was to transform raw Spotify logs into an interactive, dynamic dashboard that provides a 360-degree view of streaming patterns â€” helping users, analysts, or stakeholders understand what music is being consumed, how itâ€™s being accessed, and what factors influence engagement.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Dashboards & Features:
1. Overview Dashboard
Gives a high-level summary of Spotify usage:
Total Albums, Artists, and Tracks Played
Trends Over Time: Line charts showing yearly and monthly growth in streaming
Top 5 Albums, Artists, and Tracks by count
Year-over-Year Growth in albums, tracks, and artist engagements
Platform Filters: Android, iOS, Web, Windows, etc.
Engagement Metrics: % skipped, % shuffled

2. Listening Pattern Dashboard
Focuses on time-based user listening behavior:
Heatmap of Listening Hours vs Days of the Week
Listening Frequency vs. Average Listening Time: Scatter plot showing how long and how often tracks are played
Hourly and Daily Listening Trends: Ideal for finding peak engagement times

3. Details Dashboard
A drill-down view of all available track-level data:
Track & Album Metadata
Total Playback Duration (in ms)
Average Listening Time per Track/Album
Track Skipped/Completed Details
Full summary table with filtering/sorting capabilities

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI Desktop: For building interactive dashboards
Power Query (M Language): Used for data cleaning and transformations
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated columns, KPIs, and advanced metrics
Excel: Used for raw data formatting
SQL Server (optional): For structured data querying (if applicable)

ðŸ“Š Analytical Insights:
Identified top-performing albums, artists, and tracks based on user interaction.
Measured and visualized skip and shuffle behavior to understand engagement.
Discovered peak listening hours and days, valuable for targeted music releases.
Analyzed platform-wise usage distribution to see how users access Spotify.

ðŸ“‚ Data Fields Used:
track_name, artist_name, album_name, platform, ms_played
timestamp (ts), reason_start, reason_end, shuffle, skipped
Cleaned and normalized fields for better readability and accurate analysis

ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated:
Data Modeling and ETL in Power BI
Interactive dashboard design with user filters
Time-series trend analysis
Data storytelling and UI/UX in data visualization
Real-world application of KPIs in music analytics

ðŸš€ Outcome:
This project transformed raw, unstructured Spotify playback data into a professional BI solution. It helps demonstrate your capability in handling real-world datasets, creating powerful insights using Power BI, and presenting information in a clear and engaging way.
